DEBUGGING PRIVILEGED PROCESSES WITH NON-PRIVILEGED QTCREATOR

1. Make a copy of gdb with SETUID bit.
2. Configure QtCreator to use this new gdb.
3. Set capabilities to make QtCreator able to talk to privileged gdb process:

    sudo setcap cap_setuid,cap_setpcap,cap_kill+ep `which qtcreator`

I'm not sure if all of the listed capabilities are strictly necessary.
